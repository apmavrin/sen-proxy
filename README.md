# Middleware Proxy for SAP Enable Now On-Premise

This repository holds the source code to implement the lightweight proxy server to redirect requests coming to legacy on-premise SAP Enable Now system to the SAP Enable Now Cloud.

This helps to resolve the broken link issue when you still have references from the various 3rd party sources: i.e. documentation, courseware, portals, etc to the SAP Enable Now content that was stored on the legacy SAP Enable Now On-premise server.
